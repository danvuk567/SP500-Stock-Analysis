# Power BI S&P 500 Equity Reporting - Part 2

## Equity Return Line Charts

Our Yearly Return Chart is defined as a **Line and Clustered Column Chart** with *Year* on the *X-Axis*, *% Return* on the *Y-Axis* and *Cumulative % Return* from the *Equity_Returns_by_Year* table. 
We'll also add the *Ticker* in the *Tooltips*.
