### Finding S&P500 Equities data

Since our focus will be on Equities for this project, let's use Stocks that are components of the S&P 500 Index. One way to do this is to go to Barchart: https://www.barchart.com, create a free account and then navigate to the Indices Section and click on S&P Indices: https://www.barchart.com/stocks/indices/sp/sp500?viewName=main. Scroll down to the S&P 500 ETF Components section and click on download to export the csv. The file will look like: sp-500-index-mm-dd-yyyy.csv (mm: month, dd: day, yyyy: year)
