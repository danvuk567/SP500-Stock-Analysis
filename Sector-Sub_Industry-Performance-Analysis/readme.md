Let's do some analysis on a Sectors and Sub-Industries. We will also be adding a new function to our *custom_python_functions.py* file which can be re-used in this project. 

## Modify custom re-usable functions: *[custom_python_functions.py](https://github.com/danvuk567/SP500-Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Custom-Python-Functions/custom_python_functions.py)*

Let's define a function called *calculate_portfolio_return* which will plot a **Scatter Plot** of the our returns and draw a regression line.
